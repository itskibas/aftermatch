                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 26, 2023</p>
                <p>Welcome to AfterMatch! Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of information that is collected and recorded by AfterMatch and how we use it.</p>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>To provide you with the AfterMatch service, we must collect information about you. We collect this information in a few different ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth. You also have the option to provide more information about yourself, such as a biography, interests, and photos.</li>
                    <li><strong>Information We Get When You Use Our Services:</strong> We collect information about your activity on our services, such as how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches, clicks) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with).</li>
                    <li><strong>Information from Your Device:</strong> We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, such as hardware and software information, device ID and type, and device-specific settings and characteristics. We may also collect your geolocation with your consent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
                <p>Our main goal is to help you make meaningful connections. To do that, we use your information to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create and manage your account.</li>
                    <li>Provide our services to you, including showing your profile to other users and showing you profiles of other users.</li>
                    <li>Improve our services and develop new ones.</li>
                    <li>Perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, services, or content.</li>
                    <li>Ensure legal compliance and the safety of our users.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. How We Share Information</h2>
                <p>Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users’ information is, of course, with other users. We also share some users’ information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>With Other Users:</strong> You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you’re comfortable being publicly viewable.</li>
                    <li><strong>With Our Service Providers:</strong> We use third-party vendors to help us operate and improve our services. These vendors assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime; or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
                <p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access / Update tools in the service:</strong> Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device permissions:</strong> Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as camera and location services as well as push notifications. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at itskibas@gmail.com.</p>
